# MuFFIN_MSCA
This repository contains R codes developed during my MSCA - 890284 - MuFFIN - Modelling Foraging Fitness in Marine Predators

content of Paper_I folder:

"RCode_Analysis_Little" and "RCode_Analysis_Adelie" contains R code to manipulate raw accelerometer data

"MultipleEM..."contains R code used to run the unsupervised machine learning algorithm Expectation Maximisation on both species

"CheckEMResults.."contains R code used to check results obtained from the unsupervised machine learning algorithm Expectation Maximisation on both species

"RandomForest..." R codes for building and testing the supervised machine learning approach Random Forest on both species of penguins. "..MixSeasons" is combining the number of  breeding seasons used.

"VariabilityLittle" and "VariabilityAdelie" contains R code to run the variability analysis on the 2 species of penguins

"EnergyBalance_Adelie" contains R code to calculate Daily Energy Expenditure

"BudgetChanges" contains R code for additional general plotting functions to compare time-budgets changes obtained from the machine learning approaced used.
